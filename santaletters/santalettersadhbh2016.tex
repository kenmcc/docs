        Thank you for coming to see me at the weekend, and for the lovely letter you sent me this morning. I've checked with the Elves and they have told me that you've been a very good girl this year, and are doing very well in Creche learning lots of interesting things. Some of the things on your list are a bit difficult to make this year, but I've got a special set of presents already packed for you, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed with them.

    I know that Ronan sometimes messes with your toys and annoys you a bit, but it's very important that you continue to share with him, as you have been doing very well so far. You have to remember that he's only little and doesn't always understand what he's doing, even though it seems he's trying to wreck things he's only trying to learn.

    Don't forget to go to bed early on Christmas Eve, and don't get up before the Sun wakes up! I can't wait to try your Daddys' Mince Pies again, they were delicious last year, and please remember something for the poor Reindeer, they get very hungry flying around all night!

        p.s. Remember what I said last year about jumping on the couches and beds, and make sure you do everything your mammy and daddy tell you, especially to stop picking your nose!!
